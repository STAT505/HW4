### 1. (ROS 1.2) 4 points

Simulate and plot synthetic data with:

1. x in the range of 0 to 4 percent corresponding to the regression line with y = 30 + 10 x, with residual standard deviation of 3.9  
2. x in the range of 0 to 4 percent corresponding to the regression line with y = 30 + 10 x, with residual standard deviation of 10  
3. x in the range of 0 to 4 percent corresponding to the regression line with y = 30 + 10 x^2, with residual standard deviation of 3.9

### 2. (ROS 1.3) 3 points

Propose a situation where you might

1. Fit a regression model to estimate a relationship of interest
2. Use a regression model to adjust for differences between treatment and control groups
3. Use a regression model to make predictions.

### 3. (ROS 1.4) 2 points

Give examples of applied statistics problems of interest to you in which there are challenges in

1. Generalizing from a sample to population
2. Generalizing from a treatment to a control group
